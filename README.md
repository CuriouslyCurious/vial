# ~ vial: a micro micro-framework ~

`vial` is a small web "framework" for making small web "sites".

It only includes a few basics:

- Parsing and routing HTTP requests
- Handling POST requests
- Serving static files (css, js)

Everything else... well, that's up to you.

The goal is an as-few-as-possible-dependencies web library you can
use to test out an idea quickly or get a personal project _rolling_.
Single file, server side apps? You bet! Fast compilation? Yes please!
_Ã€ la carte_ dependencies? Now you're talkin'!

It's sort of like a picnic where the playlist is all 90s music and you
have to bring your own beverage. And food.

To get started, just add `vial` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
vial = "*"
```

## ~ hello world ~

As is tradition:

```rust
vial::routes! {
    GET "/" => |_| "Hello, world!";
}

fn main() {
    vial::run!().unwrap();
}
```

For a bit more sanity, you can route to functions directly:

```rust
use vial::prelude::*;

routes! {
    GET "/echo" => echo;
    POST "/echo" => post;
}

fn echo(_: Request) -> &'static str {
    "<form method='POST'>
        <input type='text' name='echo'/>
        <input type='submit'/>
    </form>"
}

fn post(req: Request) -> String {
    format!(
        "<h1>{}</h1>",
        req.form("echo").unwrap_or("You didn't say anything!")
    )
}

fn main() {
    vial::run!().unwrap();
}
```

To _really_ break the mold, you can split your site into different
modules:

```rust
use vial;

mod wiki;
mod blog;

mod index {
    use vial::prelude::*;
    routes! {
        GET "/" => |_| Response::from_file("index.html")
    }
}

fn main() {
    // The order matters here - if `wiki` and `blog` both define "/",
    // the `mod index` version will match first and get run.
    vial::run!(index, wiki, blog);
}
```

But hey, who wants to putz around with HTML when you can be writing
**Rust**? Enable the `horror` feature and you're on your way:

```rust
use vial::prelude::*;

routes! {
    GET "/" => |_| html! {
        p {
            : "You're looking for this: ";
            a(href="/echo") { : "echo" }
        }
    };
    GET "/echo" => echo;
    POST "/echo" => post;
}

fn echo(_: Request) -> impl Responder {
    html! {
        form(method="POST") {
            p {
            : "Type something: ";
                input(type="text", name="echo");
                input(type="submit");
            }
        }
    }
}

fn post(req: Request) -> impl Responder {
    owned_html! {
        h1: req.form("echo")
            .unwrap_or("You didn't say anything!");
    }
}

fn main() {
    vial::run!().unwrap();
}
```
