# ~ vial: a micro micro-framework ~

`vial` is a small web "framework" for making small websites, meaning
it only includes the bare minimum: parsing and routing requests to
your application, and serving static files. The goal is a way to
handle basic HTTP requests and return HTML without requiring a metric
hash-ton of dependencies. To that end, vial doesn't come with JSON or
a template engine or any of that fancy stuff - you can bring your own,
or enable one of the few compile-time features.

It's sort of like a picnic where the playlist is all 90s music and you
need to bring your own beverage. Yes, even water. Sorry.
